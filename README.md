# Odin-recipes Website

## Introduction
A basic website built as a part of the Odin Project HTML curriculum. The website is intentionally simple, just HTML, no CSS, no JavaScript.

## Skill Demonstrated
- Writing HTML boilerplate from scratch
- Using semantic HTML elements to structure content
- Creating and organizing multiple HTML pages
- Linking pages together using relative paths
- Working with images and lists
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Writing a basic project README

## Reflection
Sometimes the most important progress is invisible, like knowing why things work, not just making them look good.
